**2025 Delhi Election Press Conference for Congress Party**

Focusing on political parties as the primary pipeline to electoral representation and as gatekeepers to women’s representation, my dissertation asks two questions: (a) how do political parties define women’s access to political power within the party and (b) how do we facilitate women’s upward mobility within parties and into elected positions? I situate my research in urban India, where women’s representation lingers at a mere 10 percent in state legislatures and parties form the locus of political life. I triangulate between qualitative theory-building, original descriptive and experimental data, and qualitative theory-testing to answer my research questions.
