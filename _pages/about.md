I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Political Science and a Research Associate at the Center for the Politics of Development at the University of California, Berkeley. I focus on gender and politics in South Asia, political economy of development, and the information environment. My dissertation project looks at the pathways into politics in India and their implications for women's political ambition and representation. I am a Senior Data Science Fellow at the [D-Lab](https://dlab.berkeley.edu/people/kamya-yadav) at UC, Berkeley, where I am developing curriculum on the use of large language models (LLMs) in early-stage research and using Qualtrics to design surveys and experiments.

In the past, I have worked as a research analyst at [Graphika](https://www.graphika.com/) and as a researcher for the [Information Environment Project](https://carnegieendowment.org/projects/information-environment-project?lang=en) (formerly known as Partnership on Countering Influence Operations) at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. I hold a B.A. in Politics and minors in South Asian Studies, Political Economy, and Quantitative and Analytical Political Science from Princeton University and an M.A. in Political Science from the University of California, Berkeley.
