I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Political Science and a Research Associate at the Center for the Politics of Development at the University of California, Berkeley. I focus on gender and politics in South Asia, political economy of development, and the information environment. I am particularly interested in the political representation and participation of women, voter bias against women politicians in India, and research on the information environment, in India and more broadly.

I have worked as a researcher for the Partnership on Countering Influence Operations at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. I hold a B.A. in Politics and minors in South Asian Studies, Political Economy, and Quantitative and Analytical Political Science from Princeton University.
